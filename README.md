# KitchenCounter+
This was the final capstone project at WGU. 

**KitchenCounter+** is team-oriented inventory, request, and order system for food 
service organizations. Using Android tablets, the entire kitchen team can use 
the **KitchenCounter+** software to aggregate and automate the ordering process. 
The software's main principle is that the traditional ordering process consists of 
three parts that answer these three questions: "How much do we have?" (INVENTORY), 
"How much do we need?" (REQUEST), and, therefore, "How much do we need to order?" 
(ORDER). **KitchenCounter+** allows each team member to add items to inventory and 
the requested products list. The order section consolidates all of the entries and allows 
the purchasing manager to place orders and communicate the daily orders to the team via 
text or email.

## Build Status
- in progress; started 05/21
- ORDER section is in progress
- the sharing function in the ORDER section is in progress
- I have later plans to move the database to cloud storage; for now the DB is stored on device

## Code Style
This project was coded using the MVC model and the Room Framework. The 
source code is divided into Database, Entities, DAOs, UI (activities & fragments),
and Tables (including Views). The programming language is Java.

## Class Diagram
The structure of this application is in this diagram:

## User Interface
![kitchencounter login](images/kc_login.png)  ![kitchencounter main](images/kc_main.png)  ![kitchencounter inventory](images/kc_inventory.png)

There is a simple login page that gives you access to the app. The main UI is divided into 
three sections: INVENTORY, REQUEST, and ORDER. The main screen gives the user a simple choice
of which section they would like to enter. In the INVENTORY and REQUEST sections there is a 
main screen that displays the nine categories of products that can be counted.

Once the user has entered a product area, they are presented with a scrollable list of product
to count and a detail section in which to add a count to the total. The REQUEST section is
almost identical. Both INVENTORY and REQUEST data entry screens give the user a chance to 
navigate directly to the review section where they have a chance to delete items, go back to a 
product section to add more to inventory, or submit their daily inventory to the ORDER database.

After the INVENTORY and REQUEST activities are finished, the purchasing manager can enter the ORDER 
screen to review the numbers. They can add items from this table and, once their order is completed,
they can navigate to an order sheet. Items are now organized by Vendor and can be deleted from this screen 
if needed. The screen keeps track of orders as they are placed and there is a share function that
allows the purchasing manager to alert anyone on the team (e.g. the morning receiver)
